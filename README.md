# GIBBZ' GAMES' LAIR

## A (vain) attempt to have fun with Webpack, Npm and Single Page Application

### :scroll: Content

This repository stores the result of a 3-day mini-project proposed on week #14 of the "Developer" curriculum, a web coding bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (THP, [https://www.thehackingproject.org/](https://www.thehackingproject.org/)).  
This project consists in instantiating, configuring and manipulating a SPA using Webpack in its rawer form.  
GibbZ' Games' Lair&trade; is based on the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

### :bulb: How to

1. Clone the current :octocat: repository to your local :computer: using something as simple as `git clone .`
2. Move to the just-brought-in directory
3. Create a ".env" file in the directory then edit it to add the following line `API_KEY="<your complete RAWG key>"` into it
4. First launch the bundling and minimizing of the different files by typing `npm run build`
5. Wait... Wait again... Yes, I know, it is soooo long and sloooow
6. Still waiting? Congratulations! You should now see all builds passed and can now enter `npm run server` to see the result
7. If your web broser hasn't launched a new tab automatically then (i) insult it before (ii) browsing: `http://localhost:8000/`
8. You can finally relax and - hopefully :sweat: - have fun surfing :surfer: and exploring :eyes: GibbZ' Games' Lair
